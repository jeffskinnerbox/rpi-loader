This directory contains documents concerning the creation of various hardware and software components required for the creation of `test-pi`.
`test-pi` is a Raspberry Pi (currently a Raspberry Pi X and UPS X) and is being used as a testbed for the creation of other Raspberry Pi based designs.
The target Raspberry Pi designs are:

* Test-Pi - the foundations software & hardware to support the list below
* Home Assistant - future
* Kubernetes Cluster - future
* TBD

The main purpose of this GitHub repository is the maintenance of Ansible Playbooks & Roles to be used in the creation of the targeted Raspberry Pi designs listed above.
The documents stored here are intended to provide some use full background on





The LiFePO4wered/Pi+™ can  power a Raspberry Pi for up to nine hours from its battery
(depending on installed battery size, Raspberry Pi model, attached peripherals, and system load)
The LiFePO4wered/Pi+ with 18650 battery is compatible with all modern, genuine Raspberry Pi products (Model A+, Model B+, 2, 3, 3 Model B+, Zero, and Zero W).


Unlike other battery chemistries, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are ideally suited for use in an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) because they are:

Powerful: deliver high continuous load current
Long-lasting: thousands of recharge cycles, not hundreds
Safe: don't catch fire or explode
Stable: 3.2 - 3.3 V during most of discharge
Durable: low self-discharge rate, no memory effects, no degradation from extended charging
Environmentally friendly: no heavy metals, RoHS compliant, reusable thousands of times
Adaptable: operate in cold (down to -20°C) and hot (up to 60°C) environments
