# Note:
# The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test following the if or elif reserved words, part of any command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted with !
#
# Set +e' will revert the setting again, so you can have only certain blocks that exit automatically on errors.

# Any subsequent commands which fail will cause the shell script to exit immediately
