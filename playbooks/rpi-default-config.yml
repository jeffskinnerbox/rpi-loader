#    While your within playbook directory, check the following prior to doing the play
#
# TESTING
#    YAML linter to spot Ansible YAML syntax errors
#       yamllint rpi-default-config.yml roles/*/tasks
#       ansible-lint rpi-default-config.yml
#
#    Ansible linter to spot Ansible playbook syntax errors
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory -l test-pi rpi-default-config.yml --syntax-check
#
#    Generate a list of tasks that will be executed for the tags
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory -l test-pi rpi-default-config.yml --tags uninstall --list-tasks
#
#    Ansible dry-run checking for errors and showing results of a run
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory -l test-pi rpi-default-config.yml --tags uninstall --check
#
#    Run the playbook for real (assuming 'inventory' is up to date)
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory -l test-pi rpi-default-config.yml --tags uninstall
#
# EXECUTION
#    Run the playbook for real for the first time or after you did an 'uninstall'
#    MUST HAVE 'hosts: all' in the playbook and the ',' after the <ip address>
#       ansible-playbook -i <ip address>, rpi-default-config.yml --user pi --ask-pass --tags uninstall
